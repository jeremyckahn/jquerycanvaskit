#summary How do I get started?

= Required files =

The jQuery Canvas Kit is very easy implement.  To start, you need to include the requisite libraries:

  *jQuery 1.4.2 or above
  *jQueryUI 1.8 or above

...and all files associated with those.  Please see the jQuery site (www.jquery.com) for information regarding those libraries.  These libraries are distributed in the .ZIP packages for each JCK release for convenience.

Once you have included these files in your document, you will need to include jckstyle.css and jck.js.

= Initialization =

To extend a canvas with the JCK functionality you need to call this function:

{{{
jck(canvasElement [options]);
}}}

I'll explain the options in a moment.

The "canvasElement" is a reference to an HTML 5 canvas element, however you created it.  A handy way to to JCK-ify all of the canvases on the document at once  is with this handy jQuery snippet:

{{{
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("canvas").each(function(){
         jck(this);
    });
});
}}}

When the document loads, jQuery will traverse the entire DOM and pass each canvas element through the jck() function.

= Optional parameters =

There are a number of options that can either be set upon initialization or afterwards.  To set the options (explained momentarily), use this syntax:

{{{
jck(this,
    {
	[option1 : value1,]
	[option2 : value2,]
        ...
    });
}}}

And so on.
